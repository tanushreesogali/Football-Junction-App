        The Football Booster Camp, hosted at Avenue Sammilani Club, was a dynamic one-day event designed to encourage and inspire young footballers from local training camps. The event emphasized the importance of proper training and infrastructure for youth football development. Former professional footballer Arnab Mondal played a key role in motivating the participants through his interaction and guidance. Essential football training equipment, including footballs, kits, and training bibs, were distributed to participating clubs to support their ongoing efforts in youth development. This initiative reflects the commitment to fostering grassroots football, ensuring that young talents receive the necessary resources and encouragement to pursue their passion for the sport.
